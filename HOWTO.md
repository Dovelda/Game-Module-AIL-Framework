# How to install the module

1.  Copy all the files from the bin folder into the bin folder of AIL

2.  If you have other modules, don't use our modules.cfg and just add the lines for the module

3.  Modify the file all_modules.txt in the docs folder and add the module name

4.  If the Game module is still not running, try the following command : chmod +x Game.py
